OpenCV is a free and open-source software library for computer vision and machine learning. It is written in C++, although it provides bindings for several programming languages, including Python, Java, and MATLAB.
The purpose of OpenCV was to provide a common foundation for computer vision applications and to speed up the usage of machine perception in commercial goods.
Object detection is a computer vision mechanic that involves identifying and localizing objects of interest within an image . It is a challenging task as it involves not only recognizing the presence of an object but also detecting its precise location and size within the image .
Object detection algorithms typically use deep learning techniques, such as CNN, to analyze the image and identify objects. These algorithms can also determine the boundaries of the objects by drawing a bounding box around them.
Object detection is widely used in a variety of applications, such as autonomous vehicles, surveillance systems, and medical imaging. It is also used for tasks such as face detection, pedestrian detection, and traffic sign recognition.
